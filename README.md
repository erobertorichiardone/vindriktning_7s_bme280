# espriktning bme280

ESP8266 based board replacement for Vindriktning with PM1006 and BME280 sensors

All started from Hypfer to send PM2.5 values to MQTT server

[https://github.com/Hypfer/esp8266-vindriktning-particle-sensor](https://github.com/Hypfer/esp8266-vindriktning-particle-sensor)


Then some custom PCB to fit inside the case, because adding some object in the case seems to modify PM2.5 readings.

But we need to read the PM2.5 values directly from the  device, not only a generic light!

So the idea is to put a commercial ESP8266 board near the Vindrikning, on the USB cable. I use a D1 mini board.

I also add an additional sensor to measure temperature, humidity and pressure is simple using a small BME280 sensor.

## List of Materials

* WeMos D1 mini ESP8266 or compatible
* i2c display LCD1602
* BME280 sensor
* USB-C data cable
* Small ABS box


## Board deployment

Use Arduino 1.8.0 onward

Add ESP8266 board (File -> Preferences -> Additional Boards Manager URLs)
* http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

Add following libaries (Tools -> Library):
* 	WiFiMQTTManager Library 1.0.1-beta
* 	WiFiManager 2.0.11-beta
* 	PubSubClient 2.8.0
* 	BME280 3.0.0 by Tyler Glenn

Add the board (Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager)
* 	esp8266 3.0.2
	
Choose a compatible board (Tools -> Board -> ESP8266 Boards (3.0.2) )
* 	LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 mini (clone) 


## User configuration

At the first start, the board enables an WiFi Access Point.
Join the WiFi network, that has name "ESPriktning" with no password.
Access with web browser the address:
>  http://192.168.4.1/ 

Here under the "Configure WiFi" page you can configure:
* SSID and WPA password of your WiFi network
* IP address and TCP port of your MQTT server
* A configurable topic prefix
* Optionally username and password for MQTT authentication
 
### Measurement to MQTT

The MQTT values will be pushed to the server on the following topics:
* PM2.5 in ug/m^3 ->   PREFIX/pm2_5
* temperature in Â°C ->   PREFIX/temp
* pressure in hPa ->   PREFIX/pres
* humidity in % ->   PREFIX/hum

Sample publish values:

```
err@elitedesk:~$ mosquitto_sub -v -h localhost -t '#'
esprikningstudio/pm2_5 11
esprikningstudio/temp 32.92
esprikningstudio/pres 980.68
esprikningstudio/hum 25.13
```

If BME280 is not found, temperature, pressure and humidity are not sent.


### Reset of settings

Can be accomplished:
1. From Arduino, under Tools -> Erase Flash -> All Flash Contents
2. Physically pressing the SW2 flash pins for more that 2 seconds
3. From Arduino serial connection

## Serial interface

Write "help" from serial monitor interface. Speed is 115200 baud.

```
